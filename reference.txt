Entry point: disassembleSObjects
Get the name fields
    loop through the describes looking for either NAMEFIELD or REFERENCE type
Get a reference set of columns that are part of the collection of sobjects

Loop over the collection of columns
    if the namefields contains the field name of the current column, we have a name field columns to supplement
        grab the name field based on the previous existence with in the columns
            A name field contains a name, and object type and a namefield type (REFERENCE OR NAMEFIELD)
            Create a new attributesType for the column
            Grab a reference to that attribute type to manipulate
            Add a new label attribute to it setting that to a new Map
            Grab a reference to the new label attribute to manipulate
            Create an attribute called 'fieldName' and add the column name to it
            Add a new attribute called 'fieldName' to the column setting also to the column name
            Add a new attribute called 'type' to the column setting it to url
            
            We now have our column setup properly
            Add the link and label information for the url by calling addLinkFieldToJSONSobjects and
                passing in the collection of Json objects (records) passed to the entry point
                and construct a virtual file prefixed with 'Link_' and the name of the field reference and the
                type of object it is referencing. This adds new fields to the records

                'Link_' + col.fieldName, namefield.objectType

add the newly generated columns to the list of columns generated above
Now, we can loop over the final set of data and run queries to supplement the reference ids with name field
values, that connects up the column definitions with data
